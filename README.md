# SqrHw
We propose the Square-Highway (SqrHw) network, a variant of the Highway network that regularizes weight updates via a modified affine transformation. In surface construction tasks, SqrHw shows superior convergence and stability over MLPs and other normalization methods, with analyses revealing improved network robustness.
